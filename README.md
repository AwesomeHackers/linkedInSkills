<h1>Automate LinkedIn Endorsements!</h1>
  <h3>Save your click-finger!</h3>
<p>
A way to automate endorsing others on linkedin: we might improve on this so maybe updates
for now it automatically endorses the skills:
First shout-out to our devs team @Christopher Carney @David Bernstein (https://github.com/dangitbobbeh) @Timeo and me n_n (https://github.com/WeilanCui)!
  <ul>
<li>Step 1: Go to LinkedIn, navigate to a colleagueâ€™s page</li>
<li>Step 2: Scroll down to the skills section and click "show more."</li>  
<li>Step 3: Open chrome dev tools and copy-paste useThisOne script into the console. Make sure the page is loaded.</li>
<li>Step 4: Press enter. This will endorse a pile of skills. May not get all the buttons -->Do it again to get more of them! You can manually click the remaining or just move on with your life or gotta catch em all!</li></ul>
