Hi guys we found a way to automate the sharing skills on linkedin: we might improve on this so  maybe updates
for now it automatically endorses the skills:
First shout-out to our devs team @Christopher Carney @David Bernstein @Timeo and me n_n!
Step 1: Go to LinkedIn, navigate to a classmate’s page
Step 3: Open chrome dev tools and copy-paste useThisOne script into the console. wait like 2 seconds till page loaded.
Step 4: Press enter. This will endorse a pile of skills. May not get all the buttons -->Do it again to get more of them! You can manually click the remaining or just move on with your life or gotta catch em all!
